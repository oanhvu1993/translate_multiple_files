00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,105
Hello, this is John from

2
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:06,680
CaveOfProgramming.com and in this
tutorial, we're

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,330
gonna look at using visual designers to
visually design your swing code.

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,490
Now you might wonder why I didn't show you
this to start with and this is kind

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,470
of high up on the list of priorities of a
lot of people who come to swing.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,680
And but the fact is the visual designers
for java are not great.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,010
They're not good as the visual designers
for the Windows,

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,590
largely Windows specific C Sharp and
Visual Basic for example.

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,120
And you sort of have to know almost all
the things

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,770
that I've shown you to be able to use them
effectively.

11
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:47,010
But nevertheless, they can save you time
and a lot of people do prefer to use them.

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,342
Although, all the professional java
developers

13
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:51,740
I've known, including myself, sort of

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,280
just prefer to write things by hand
because you know, you have more

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,220
control over your code, and once you know
what you're doing it,

16
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,650
it doesn't really save that much time to
use a visual designer, arguably.

17
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,610
And, anyway if you do want to there's one
very well-known

18
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,177
one you can use, I don't like at all
myself, called NetBeans.

19
00:01:13,177 --> 00:01:18,090
And I find NetBeans slow and all the kind

20
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,230
of developers that I've known have kind of
argued that

21
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,470
they don't wanna use it because NetBeans
ties you to

22
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,770
NetBeans as far as I know, unless this has
changed.

23
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,750
You can't edit code that you've visually
designed in NetBeans, which is

24
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,840
a real disadvantage, snd I just don't find
it nice to work with.

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,540
But it is free, and and it does work.

26
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,680
So you may want to use that.

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,940
And a lot of people, I'm sure, do use it,
including, professionally no doubt.

28
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,770
The one that I recommend is an Eclipse
plugin called WindowBuilderPro.

29
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,400
So if you go to Google, and just search
for Window.

30
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,970
This is free, by the way.

31
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,830
Window builder, pro, in spite of the pro
name google

32
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,690
actually purchased this product, I
believe, and released it free.

33
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,920
It's free, it's a free Eclipse plugin, and

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,050
it's very nice, so if you search in
Google,

35
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:15,040
you'll find instructions for using it,
although last time

36
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,520
I checked the documentation was a little
bit sparse.

37
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,820
And, you'll find instructions for
installing it

38
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,370
as well, and the installation basically
consists

39
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,500
probably in going to, depending on your

40
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,690
version of Eclipse something like install
new software.

41
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,490
And then you'll have to add probably a new
plugin site here.

42
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,810
And then you'll just check the Window
Builder Pro check

43
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,020
box and go through the wizard, and it will
install it.

44
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,130
It takes a while, and you might think that
Eclipse is frozen while it's doing it.

45
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:51,720
But it actually seems to pretty much
always install without any instant.

46
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,350
So and then it's, you know, it's easy to
install and it's pretty nice to use.

47
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,530
But again, it is a fairly thin layer over
swing code.

48
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,850
So it will really help if you know Swing
programming, anyway, to use it.

49
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,570
Okay, so let's take a look.

50
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,250
At the moment I've got this applet.

51
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,960
And what I'm gonna do is in this tutorial,
I'm gonna

52
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,590
just add a really simple panel, which I'm
gonna visually design.

53
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,670
It's gonna be a start panel.

54
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,780
I'm gonna make it so that you click a
button on the start

55
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,980
panel and it goes into this game or
simulation or whatever you call it.

56
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,920
And we're also gonna look a little bit
later at,

57
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,440
refine, at making this bat actually work,
by the way.

58
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,810
But that's for a future tutorial.

59
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:41,940
So I'm gonna right click my GUI package
here, and go to new, other.

60
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,610
Where are we, other?

61
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,440
At the bottom there, and once you've
installed Window Builder, you'll have

62
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,820
among er, among these other options you'll
have this WindowBuilder item here.

63
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,740
And you can use WindowBuilder to design

64
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:03,720
interfaces using various GUI kind of
packages.

65
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,240
Swing is one of them.

66
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,570
SWT is another that's a bit similar to
Swing but

67
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,110
it's apparently it gives you a look and
feel that's

68
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,840
more similar to kind of native platforms,
and I've heard

69
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,850
that it's more efficient than Swing in
terms of memory.

70
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,350
I don't know.

71
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,820
So you might wanna use that.

72
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,280
And, if you've, don't worry if you, if

73
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,330
you've learned Swing, and then you wanna
use SWT.

74
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,160
You'll find so many of the concepts are
trans-variable.

75
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,140
And but I'm gonna use Swing here, because
we're, we're working with Swing.

76
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,930
This is a Swing series.

77
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,760
So you can design your application from
scratch, using Swing Designer.

78
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,650
You can create your application window, or
your J

79
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,990
Frames, or whatever, or your applet, using
this visual designer.

80
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,550
And, but, you can also equally well just
add particular

81
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,850
panels to, or features or dialogues, or
whatever, using Swing Designer.

82
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,410
And that's what I'm gonna do here to an
existing application.

83
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:06,920
And so I'm gonna click J panel here, hit
next and it's

84
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,640
got GUI pack, GUI package here because I
right-clicked that to start with.

85
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,290
Yeah of course the package is kind of
optional and

86
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,920
in the name, I'm just gonna call this
start panel.

87
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,020
And the Window Builder Pro the really nice
thing about it, have I said this already?

88
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,150
I don't think so.

89
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,630
Is that it allows you to switch between

90
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,020
your code and the visual designer, which
is fantastic.

91
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,530
So you can work a bit in the visual
designer and go to code, edit it

92
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,310
there, and switch back to visual designer
and

93
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,860
so on which is really a wonderful feature.

94
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:43,380
And when I click finish here, and so here
we've got a, we've got obviously,

95
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,380
code, but if I click the design type here,
we're going to the visual designer.

96
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:54,480
And I'm gonna start by, now if you start
just putting, you can

97
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,040
select components already down here and
just drag them onto here.

98
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,580
But if you do that, I think the

99
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,800
default layout manager is equivalent and
set layout null.

100
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,390
It's called absolute layout in this visual
designer.

101
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,190
And then, if you resize your panel, your
components are just gonna stay

102
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,620
where they are and it's not gonna look
very nice when it resizes.

103
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,685
So for that reason, I'm gonna set an
explicit layout.

104
00:06:18,685 --> 00:06:23,200
I'm gonna right click here and go to Set
Layout.

105
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,370
And I'm gonna, so we've probably got
absolute layout at the moment.

106
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,027
But I'm gonna set GridBug layout here so
that

107
00:06:30,027 --> 00:06:33,960
it will be, so that it will resize nicely.

108
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,950
And I'm just gonna make this a really
simple

109
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,960
panel, just to really, just to get you
started.

110
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,930
And I'm gonna [UNKNOWN] a, a label and a
button on it.

111
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,480
So are my components.

112
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:53,830
I'm gonna click label, and add that to the
uppermost left hand cell here and I'll

113
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:58,330
say new simulation maybe, no actually I
won't,

114
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,330
that what I'm gonna put on my bottom
button.

115
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:06,700
I'm gonna say Swing applet demo on this
label.

116
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,930
And I'm gonna add a button as well, so
I'll click that and then click on the cell

117
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:20,190
underneath here, and here I'll say, new
simulation, new simulation.

118
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,060
Now I don't want them bunched up in a
corner like that, and what

119
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,610
I'm gonna do is this took me quite a while
to find out because

120
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,930
at least at the time I looked, the
documentation was a bit lacking, but

121
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,330
if you go to, look at the borders here,
you've got these white areas.

122
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:39,080
And you can drag the edges of those, I can
make it fill up the panel here.

123
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,540
And I'll drag this upper most one lower
edge, down to about halfway.

124
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,840
And this lower one I'll drag, halfway as
well.

125
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:54,840
And I'll just click the label and if, if
you go into the properties panel here.

126
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,250
Properties designer, whatever it's called,
browser you can set various

127
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,910
properties like the background color of
your label or the font.

128
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,670
Let's set the font in fact.

129
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:09,340
So whatever component you've got selected,
you can see the properties of it here, and

130
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:18,170
I'm gonna click font here and just change
that to maybe, 20, there we go.

131
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,630
And with this panel still selected I'm
gonna, if

132
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,510
I look up here, I've got the constraints
of

133
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,730
my grid bug layout, and I've got my
properties

134
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,040
of those, which we covered in the previous
tutorial.

135
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,980
So for example, you can change grid
height, and grid width if

136
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,609
you want a cell that spans more than one
row, or column.

137
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,340
But I'm gonna actually change.

138
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,830
And there's, there's a way to actually.

139
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:49,452
If I, let's set the weight y to, 0.5.

140
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:56,615
And select the lower one there and go to
layout here

141
00:08:56,615 --> 00:09:03,652
and hopefully here I'll also have similar
options.

142
00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:09,039
Not sure where, I got sletlor I think in
the visual designer

143
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:14,099
there, and then if I browse down here,
wait y, I can set

144
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:18,947
that to 0.5 as well and with my button
selected

145
00:09:18,947 --> 00:09:24,225
I'm gonna set the anchor, anchor here to
north, and

146
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:29,550
I'm gonna select the label and set the
anchor to south.

147
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,520
Scroll down here.

148
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,220
Where are we?

149
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,650
South.

150
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,868
And with the label still selected I'm also
gonna set the insets.

151
00:09:38,868 --> 00:09:42,555
So let's, or actually, maybe on the
bottom, so I'll select the bottom —

152
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:46,428
I'll look for insets and these are all
cross properties of my grid back layout.

153
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:52,232
And let's just make the top here like 20,
20 pixels.

154
00:09:52,232 --> 00:09:52,905
There we go.

155
00:09:52,905 --> 00:09:53,950
That doesn't look too bad.

156
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:01,310
so, yeah, I could change the background if
I wanted, off the panel.

157
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,040
I don't whether to do that or not really.

158
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,650
Well, you get the idea.

159
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,660
And you can see your different components
here.

160
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,310
You can select them using this component
browser as well.

161
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,790
And you can test your, test your like
dialog, whatever it is,

162
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,610
quickly by just clicking this here and see
what it looks like.

163
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,860
And let's see if it resizes okay.

164
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,130
It doesn't.

165
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,150
Now I must confess I don't know how to fix
that in the

166
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,720
visual designer, but the beauty of this,
if I go back to source

167
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,590
here, you can see that it's setting
specific row heights and column heights

168
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,380
and I'm just going to delete those with
Ctrl+D, to delete the line.

169
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,960
So I want the weights.

170
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,150
I just don't want the widths.

171
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,500
And let's go to Save All and go back to
Design and click Run here.

172
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,750
And now if I maximize it, it resizes
nicely.

173
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,110
Hey presto.

174
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,920
And that's really the beauty of this
Window Builder

175
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,500
Pro and the reason why I like it so

176
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,560
much, is that whenever you get stuck, you
can

177
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,840
always go to the source and do a Google

178
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,210
search on how to do something in the
source

179
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,020
code and figure out how to do it there

180
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,900
rather than wrestle with the designer
which is at

181
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,070
times a little bit opaque, but it's not
too bad.

182
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:13,356
Okay.

183
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:16,520
So let's wire that panel in, and I'm gonna
do

184
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,540
that just by going to game, going to main,
actually.

185
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,990
I'm gonna give it a private, a private
instance variable.

186
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,370
This is my applet, main sort-of class,

187
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:33,070
private start panel, start panel, I'll
call it.

188
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:38,320
And in it, I'll say start panel equals,
whoops, I

189
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,740
get confused between the two keyboard
layouts that I have.

190
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:49,440
But okay, equals new start panel and just
for the moment, just for this tutorial, I,

191
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:56,710
I will replace game with start panel and
if I run that now, and there we go.

192
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:01,200
And this doesn't do anything, I can
maximize it and it still looks fine.

193
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,310
Should look fine at pretty much any size,
ehich is what I wanted.

194
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,570
That's good.

195
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,070
Okay.

196
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,700
Now yeah.

197
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,790
One last thing for this tutorial.

198
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,979
I'm gonna go back to this start panel here

199
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:15,510
and go to the, well, I'm in the visual
designer.

200
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,390
And if you click the button and, and you
right click,

201
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:21,480
you can see that you can add event time
list here.

202
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,970
For example, I could add an action event
handler, and there are

203
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,534
also all these other event handlers that
you can add, and you

204
00:12:27,534 --> 00:12:30,570
could do, you could add all these of
course, manually, in the

205
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,420
code, but you've got the option to add
them here as well.

206
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,680
Now, to add the action event list, now,
there's a shortcut, because if you double

207
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,630
click the button like that, it will add

208
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:43,380
this anonymous class for you that
implements ActionListener.

209
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:49,530
So now, if I put a sysout in there,
Ctrl+Space and hello.

210
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,740
If I run that, then I click the button and
hello

211
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,830
comes out in the console down there, which
is, it's really nice.

212
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:01,070
Now what I want is for the start panel to
raise a

213
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:07,290
kind of event, that's gonna tell the the
main program to do stuff.

214
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:12,440
So if you feel comfortable with kind of
creating your own custom events, then you

215
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,720
can stop watching now because I'm not

216
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,660
going to cover anything else in this
tutorial.

217
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,710
We've covered this before, but if you want
revision because this

218
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:23,310
is a, a bit of a tricky topic then stay
tuned.

219
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,440
So I'm just going to right click the GUI

220
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,530
package, go to new interface and create an
interface here.

221
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:34,370
I'll call it, start panel listener.

222
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,120
Click finish.

223
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,500
And I'm going to give this one method,
public void start Game.

224
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,030
Like that.

225
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:51,493
And in my main class I'm gonna

226
00:13:51,493 --> 00:13:56,860
say actually I'm thinking I'll leave that
for a minute because in the start panel,

227
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:03,040
I'm gonna edit this code by hand, so I'm
gonna give it a private,

228
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,793
private start panel listener, listener.

229
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:13,555
And let's just pass listeners to

230
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:20,760
constructor, so start, start panel in
fact, let's not do that

231
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,080
because I just thought maybe that would
give me

232
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,260
problems with my visual designer actually,
I'm not sure.

233
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:31,870
What I'll do is, I'll go down here, and as
I've done before many times in

234
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:37,420
these, in this series, I'll create public
void, set, listener.

235
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,370
And that takes start, start panel,
listener.

236
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:47,270
And if you wanted multiple things to
listen to the same panel, you would

237
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:52,740
just need to create an array of listeners
up here, instead of a single reference.

238
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,990
Like it could be just an array list.

239
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,350
And this method will be called add
listener and

240
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,570
it will just add your listener to that
array list.

241
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,460
Or you could have just separate variables
for different listeners.

242
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,560
It doesn't matter.

243
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,450
And I'll say, start.

244
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,185
Now, I call it listening type, so this,
whoops, where are we?

245
00:15:12,185 --> 00:15:19,580
This.listener, equals listener so that
allows

246
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:27,040
me to set the listener, and then let's
just have a private void fire, start game.

247
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,320
And what that will do is it will say if
this listener

248
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:42,545
is not equal to null, then
listener.startgame.

249
00:15:42,545 --> 00:15:48,918
Now finally, in my main, my main class
here, I can say, after

250
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:54,696
creating a start panel I can say
startpanel.add.set,

251
00:15:54,696 --> 00:15:59,220
sorry, set listener I think I called it.

252
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,090
Set listener, new start panel listener.

253
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,790
And there we go.

254
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:09,920
Let's get rid of some of this extraneous
code, and add a

255
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,280
semicolon there, and in here just to prove
it works, so I'll do a sysout.

256
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,466
Hello there, and this is gonna start my
game.

257
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:28,050
But it's for this tutorial, I'm just gonna
leave it with this basically.

258
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,690
And then in this action performed here,

259
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,080
and the button, the action performed of
the

260
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:40,020
button on the start panel, I'm just gonna
call fire, start game, fire start game.

261
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,420
And fire start game just says okay, for

262
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,360
this is not null, call it start game
method.

263
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,870
And the listener that has been added,
listener's been added using set listener.

264
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,460
And, that's actually this anonymous class
here.

265
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,280
So it starts actually calling this method.

266
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,240
And if I run that, now, I click the
button, and there we go.

267
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,440
It says hello there, which is coming from
there.

268
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,270
So that's it for this tutorial.

269
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,560
Have fun with the visual designer.

270
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,100
And join me again next time.

271
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,440
And until next time, happy coding.
