00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,940
Hello this is John from cave of programming to come.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:09,840
I'm actually having this video I think about two years after recording this swing course.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,180
And there are three things that I want to tell you about in this video.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:20,740
The first is the applet support in browsers is even less good than it used to be.

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,940
I think the splits are really on the way out.

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,140
So in the code that I'm about to show you are going to cover animation.

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,320
I'm going to do it in the context of an Aplin.

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,750
And that's all going to work in Eclipse.

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,990
But there's one video where I show you how to deploy it they apply applet with h.t. email.

10
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:46,710
Now the Chrome browser I believe removes support for applets basically in April of this year which is

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,600
now 2015.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,320
So you won't be able to get up to work on Chrome and it won't work on opera.

13
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,110
It should work on other browsers.

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,260
Although you may have to fiddle around with your security settings to get it to work.

15
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:08,790
And the only place where I've really ever seen applets used seriously is has been in in-house software

16
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:17,040
where people can control centrally the browsers that people are using and the security settings as well.

17
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,400
So the bottom line is this tutorial is still good it's still good for learning about animation especially

18
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,520
But when we come to that video on deploying applets he might want to consider skipping that.

19
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,800
Unless you envisage you might be developing an in-house applet some some day you know for use within

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,570
a company and then it's still hopefully relevant.

21
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,740
So what I'll do is just to kind of remedy that habit is at the end of this section.

22
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,610
I'll add a video.

23
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:53,580
It shows you how to turn this code into a desktop swing application and that's also quite a good thing

24
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,330
that you could have a go yourself if you want a little bit of a challenge which you should be able to

25
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:57,920
do.

26
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,200
If you follow this course so far so that the code that were going to see is going to work in Eclipse.

27
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,960
It's only that one video on deploying the apla that is potentially going to be tricky and if you're

28
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,790
using Chrome or opera it just won't work now unfortunately anymore.

29
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:21,630
So the other couple of things that I want to mention is that I have got a Mac computer now and when

30
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,500
I tried to run this coupler in the Mac.

31
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,800
So if I do this this is what it should look like so we should end up with this at the end of the course

32
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,970
and it's a ball bouncing off a bat.

33
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,630
But in fact let's just go back.

34
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,980
I found that it actually initially crashed.

35
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:46,440
So there's this game Java where were going to develop a sort of component that shows this bouncing ball

36
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,060
bouncing around sort of custom components.

37
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:56,640
And this has got in it some code for hiding the cursor and the way we do that is we create a blank image

38
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:06,000
and set that to be the cursor using this hidden cursor equals get toolkit create custom cursor thing.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,030
Now the problem is that when you create a cursor you have to specify a hot spot and that's the spot

40
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:18,990
within the cursor image that actually clicks on things and originally in the code that you're going

41
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,300
to see in the following section.

42
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:27,010
I set that spot to be 1 1 and if you do that I discovered on a Mac it doesn't actually work.

43
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,960
Let's try that again.

44
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,990
Go to runouts what happens is it.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,170
This is sort of blank the applet viewer from Eclipse and we get this sort of traceback an exception.

46
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,240
And if you look for the first line in here it's actually in code that that we've written that were going

47
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,130
to write in the following section.

48
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:52,020
It's right here on this line it creates the custom cursor and that can be fixed by setting the hotspot

49
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,080
to point zero zero.

50
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,260
Then it works.

51
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,940
So in theory swing ups are completely cross platform but it's true that sometimes they're not as crass

52
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,700
a cross platform as you'd like.

53
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:12,780
And if you really want to deploy swing application of any kind it is good practice to test it on all

54
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,120
the platforms all the different versions of operating systems that you might want to deploy it on which

55
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,140
unfortunately I can't do.

56
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,830
I used to have windows and I've got just Mac but this is the only thing I've discovered that really

57
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:31,740
doesn't work at least on this version of the Mac operating system.

58
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,230
So let's let's run that again now.

59
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,600
And now it's fine.

60
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:41,490
The other just little minor point is when I developed this program as you are going to see in the following

61
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,410
section.

62
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:47,250
We've got this bit where we've got like a bat that we use to bounce a ball around.

63
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,720
And originally when we detect an intersection of the ball with the bat I reverse the x and y direction

64
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,630
and the ball.

65
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,930
But that gives a very unnatural bounce because it means that the ball.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,920
Bounces off at the same angle that it hit the baton like this which is which is a bit strange.

67
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,560
I don't know why I did that originally Really.

68
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,560
So to fix that if you don't improve that habit just comment out the pit of code that you're going to

69
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,880
see soon which reverses the x direction of the ball.

70
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,990
Only reverse the y direction when it hits the bat.

71
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,250
So that's that's it basically.

72
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,730
And so my suggestion is that you work through this code.

73
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:34,170
Get the applet running any clips you might want to skip the section on deploying applets because you

74
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:38,550
might you might see an applet if you're running in-house software within a company.

75
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,470
But other than that to be honest they're not really that much use.

76
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,810
And they've always been a bit rubbish.

77
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,390
You know they used to lock up your browser and stuff.

78
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:53,310
If you do want to deploy a job application on the Internet you can do it with Java Web start and then

79
00:05:53,310 --> 00:06:00,360
it doesn't run within the browser or at least the way that works in all browsers won't run within the

80
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,220
browser on Chrome.

81
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,830
For example you have to download a little farm and click on it and that starts a job program on your

82
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,860
desktop.

83
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,670
That's kind of outside the scope of this tutorial.

84
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,860
It's a little bit involved.

85
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:20,490
You have to do some command line stuff a little bit to sign your jaw and to deploy it on the Internet.

86
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:26,550
You'd also have to pay for a certificate from a certificate authority so are not going to go into that

87
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:31,380
but if you did want to deployer Java out from the Internet that would probably be the best way to do

88
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:31,530
it.

89
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,940
And it's called Java Web start.

90
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:40,590
Okay so I'll leave it there for now and I'm going to add a extra video as well at the end of this section

91
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,410
on how to turn your apla into a Swingle that runs on the desktop.

92
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,580
Okay so until next time.

93
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,230
Happy coding.
