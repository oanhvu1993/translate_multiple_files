Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com and in this

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,680
tutorial we're gonna look at key listeners
in Java.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,550
So key listeners are actually somewhat
similar to mouse listeners

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,630
although a bit different at the same time
of course.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,240
So if I go to my, I've got my J component
here.

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,690
And now you can add a key listener to a
particular

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,590
component by saying add key listener and
then passing in a

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,640
new key listener you could say like new
key listener, and

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,060
then just have an anonymous class

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,380
here that implements this keyListener
interface.

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:43,095
And just as we've done for
mouseMotionListener.

12
00:00:43,095 --> 00:00:47,490
But the problem with that is, you'll have
problems with focus,

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,640
because to add a keyListener to your
component, it must be focusable.

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:59,350
So you may need to call setFocusable,
setFocusable and set that to true.

15
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,370
And also it must have the focus in order
to receive key events.

16
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,160
And that can be problematic at times and
if that's what you want to do.

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,140
If you just want a key listener that does
a particular thing in a

18
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,930
particular text field for example, then
you probably want to do add key listener.

19
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,990
But here, I'm gonna add a sort of global
key listener, that

20
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:24,530
intercepts all the key clicks that the
applications gets because it's it means

21
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,090
that my J component, which takes up the
whole screen in this

22
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,090
case, doesn't have to have the keyboard
focus which is what I want.

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:39,260
So I'm gonna say get default I'm gonna
say, actually, keyboard,

24
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:45,220
keyboard focus manager, keyboard focus
manager dot

25
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,740
and we're gonna use a static method of the

26
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,650
keyboard focus manager class called get
current keyboard focus manager.

27
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:56,220
And this kind of manages the keyboard
somehow.

28
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,790
And I'm gonna say add key event
dispatcher.

29
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,780
And, cause this will allow me to add a
class that can intercept my key events,

30
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,200
and the rest of what I'm gonna show you
now is very similar to what you'd do if

31
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,720
are adding, just doing add key list now on
a particular component, so I need a new

32
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,240
key event dispatcher here, rather than a
new key,

33
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,090
keyListener as would be the case without a
keyListener.

34
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,720
And let's just add, create an anonymous
class there, at the import.

35
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,560
Ctrl+Shift+O and right, and left-click
this

36
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,730
arrow and go to add unimplemented methods.

37
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,080
And we're just going to implement this

38
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,430
dispatchKeyEvent and keyListener has an
equivalent method.

39
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,620
And I'll just call it keyEvent.

40
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,690
That's passed in.

41
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,090
I'll just call it E.

42
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,250
Let's get rid of some of this [UNKNOWN].

43
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,990
And you return true here.

44
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,010
If you wanna say we've handled the key,
don't pass it on anywhere else.

45
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,280
And, otherwise, you return false.

46
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,580
And I'm just gonna return false always
here because I wanna

47
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,840
handle keys, but I don't wanna stop other
things potentially handling them.

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,390
Not that there are any other things, but

49
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,280
if there were I wouldn't want to stop
them.

50
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,358
So, and now here I'm going to say switch.

51
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:19,580
Actually I'll say int key equals e dot get
key code.

52
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:26,020
And now I wanna, in this case I wanna
detect which arrows have been clicked.

53
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,320
So you could just do a sysout on key here
and

54
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,660
press keys and see what key code comes up,
if you're curious.

55
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:39,910
I'm gonna do, like, switch key and, then
let's

56
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,070
say case and I'm gonna use key event
class.

57
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,510
And this is the same for if you do add

58
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:52,070
key listener and there there's a, for
example, a I

59
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,750
think it's arrow up.

60
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,430
I can never remember these values.

61
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,980
Let's just take a look.

62
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,050
Yeah, we got a bunch of, v case stands for
virtual key.

63
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:09,580
And the constants that you need for things
like the function keys and the arrow keys.

64
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,000
They're all vk this, vk that.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,490
So we've got a vk up, for example, so
let's add vk up.

66
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:23,150
So if the key code equals vk up, let's
just put a break in there.

67
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,780
And just for now let's just do sysout
Ctrl+Space Return up.

68
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,090
Let's, now let's run that and check that
it's working.

69
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,270
So if I hit the up key now.

70
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,910
We can see that in a console it says up.

71
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,540
So that seems to be working.

72
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,050
And I'm gonna, mix my C editor here.

73
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:52,830
And that's, in the case that up is is
called.

74
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,330
I've got a bat shape object that's an
instance variable.

75
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,200
And I'm drawing the bat thing on the
screen.

76
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,430
And I'm updating, I'm repainting the
screen like every 20 milliseconds.

77
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,770
So I'm just gonna say back dot y, and if I
wanna

78
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,590
go up, I have to say negative equals let's
call this bat speed.

79
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,400
So because y increases down the screen,
and the screen redraws from the top.

80
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,050
And I'm just gonna add it, add in a prior
date.

81
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:29,200
Double that speed, which I'll set equal
to, I don't know, maybe 10.

82
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,150
10.0, there we go.

83
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:38,560
So I'm gonna move my bat in response to
the key being pressed.

84
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,620
Now, let's just copy these because I want
four

85
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,580
of them, so one, two, one, two, three,
four.

86
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:51,830
And I'm gonna have down, which is gonna
add to the position of the bat.

87
00:05:51,830 --> 00:06:01,476
And I'm gonna have vk left, the left arrow
key, which is gonna subtract from X.

88
00:06:01,476 --> 00:06:07,340
And vk right is gonna add to

89
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:13,620
x here, so, let's have add, and with a bit
of luck now, I'm gonna hit,

90
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,790
use the arrow keys to move the to move
this sort of bat thing around.

91
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:25,180
Okay, so that's it for this tutorial and
join me again next time.

92
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,130
And until next time, happy coding.
