Hello, this is John, from
caveofprogramming.com, and

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,220
in this tutorial, we're going to look

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:15,630
at how to find out when your component has
been resized, which is often useful.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,430
So if I run this now, the whole screen

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,680
on my Applet is taken up by this custom
component.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,280
And I'm actually doing some double

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,510
buffering, as I explained in previous
tutorials.

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,770
But it means that I've got an image here
that I'm drawing to, but if I resize my

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:37,510
component, then the image doesn't change
its size, even

10
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,180
though the custom component I've got has
become bigger.

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,100
So what I need to do is create a bigger
image where my component's resized.

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,680
And for that I need to intercept the
resize event.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,340
So I'm gonna go into my custom component
code

14
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,480
here, which is called Gain, and it extends
J component.

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,690
And in the Constructor here, where I've
already got a bunch of stuff

16
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,630
listening to the mouse, and keys

17
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,710
among other things, I'm gonna say
addComponentListener.

18
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,291
Now componentListener takes a class that

19
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:12,893
implements a componentListener interface,
but a componentListener

20
00:01:12,893 --> 00:01:16,385
interface has quite a lot of methods, and
I don't need most of them.

21
00:01:16,385 --> 00:01:21,974
So I'm gonna use here, not a new
componentListener anonymous class, but a

22
00:01:21,974 --> 00:01:26,780
new componentAdapter, adapter, which
implements kinda dummy

23
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,641
versions of all of the componentListener
methods.

24
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:34,624
Let's do Ctrl + Shift to override the
imports, and I'll

25
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:39,650
right-click in there and go to Source >
Override Implement Methods, and

26
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,660
these are all the, well actually, there's
only four of them, componentAdapter

27
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:48,520
methods, and I just want to deal with the
componentResized method here.

28
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,290
And I all I need to do for this tutorial

29
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:56,380
actually, is, is just set my buffer, my
image to null.

30
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,380
If the component is resized because I got

31
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,190
this code that I did in the previous
tutorial

32
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,460
in Paint component, that creates a new
buffered image

33
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,350
at the right size if the buffer is null.

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,865
So if I run this now, and I resize it, my
component that I am correctly, intercepts

35
00:02:16,865 --> 00:02:21,760
to resize event and it makes my, my
buffer,

36
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,110
my double buffer bigger or smaller as is
necessary.

37
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,600
So that's it for this tutorial, join me

38
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,165
again next time and until next time, happy
coding.

39
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:33,874
