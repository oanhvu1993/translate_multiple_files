00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,350
Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com,

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,990
and in this tutorial we're gonna look

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,970
at listening to the mouse and finding out
what the mouse is doing.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,920
And I'm gonna make this bat move around
with the mouse.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,320
So this is an applet, but one swing here
applies to any kind of swing application.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,780
And I've got this custom component down
here which I called game.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,460
But it's actually extending JComponent in
this case.

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,810
And I'm gonna give this the constructor
some public game.

9
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:33,330
Like this.

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,790
And then in the constructor, I'm going to
say at mouse.

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,380
Now, you can add a mouse motion listener.

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,138
A mouse listener or a mouse wheel
listener, and in this

13
00:00:43,138 --> 00:00:48,056
tutorial well, for now I'm gonna use add
mouse motion listener.

14
00:00:48,056 --> 00:00:55,300
And I'm gonna say new mouse motion
listener in there and that's an interface.

15
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,310
So I'm gonna have an anonymous class here
which

16
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:06,220
implements the two methods, mouse dragged
and mouse moved.

17
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,570
Let's get rid of stuff that we don't
really need here.

18
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:17,040
And in mouse moved I'm gonna, let's just
duce this out for the moment and

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,180
say, e.get getX to get the X position of
the mouse.

20
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,430
And if I run that now if I move my mouse
over

21
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,790
here, you can see that we're getting the
exposition of the mouse.

22
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,610
Now just to do something with that for the
moment I'm gonna

23
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:43,600
take this and draw in this kind of
rectangle somewhere in here.

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:43,940
Let's see.

25
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,120
So I've got this, where it's a round
rectangle.

26
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,390
I'm gonna take that out of there.

27
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,490
And I'm actually gonna do, I'll do Ctrl+X.

28
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,600
And I'm gonna call that, bat.

29
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,900
Because it's gonna be like a bat to hit
the ball with, ultimately.

30
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,320
And up here, I'm gonna say private.

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,616
Let's paste in that code that I just cut.

32
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:09,955
And I'm gonna say,
privaterectangle2D.double bat, equals.

33
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:10,885
So we're drawing the bat.

34
00:02:10,885 --> 00:02:12,975
Let's check that that still works.

35
00:02:12,975 --> 00:02:14,385
Don't know why it's so much smaller now.

36
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:16,225
And

37
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:18,915
let's run that.

38
00:02:18,915 --> 00:02:19,845
There we go, okay.

39
00:02:19,845 --> 00:02:20,705
So there's my bat.

40
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:22,350
And now I'm gonna say here.

41
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:33,680
When the mouse is moved, I'm going to say
bat.x equals e.getX.

42
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,795
So I'm going to get the X coordinate of my

43
00:02:35,795 --> 00:02:39,295
mouse from the mouse event that's passed
into mou, mouse moved.

44
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:42,300
And just set the position of the bat to
it.

45
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,280
And since I've already got animation code

46
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,310
in here that's updating the screen
regularly,

47
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,920
which I showed you in previous tutorials,

48
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,810
that should move the bat around the
screen.

49
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,430
So, let's let's run this, and then we go,
it's following my mouse.

50
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:00,900
And, actually I, I probably don't want it
to follow the I probably want the bat to

51
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:08,110
center on the mouse, so to fix that I'm
just gonna do bat.x.

52
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,910
Equals bat.,

53
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:18,654
I think, I think I wanna say that the X
position of the bat is gonna equal

54
00:03:18,654 --> 00:03:25,740
e.getX, negative bat.get with over 2.

55
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:33,056
And the Y position, I'm gonna subtract
bat.get height over two.

56
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:37,950
Just to put the the bat, there we go, in
the center of where the mouse is.

57
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,980
Now if you wanted to detect mouse clicks,

58
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,370
it's pretty much the same, with a little
twist.

59
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,070
So I am gonna say, add mouse, add mouse
listener this time.

60
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,590
Now, I could say here, new mouse listener,
but mouse listener has a lot of

61
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,990
methods, it has like five or something and
I don't wanna overwrite all of them.

62
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,890
So, I am gonna use a mouse adapter

63
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:04,210
and a mouse adapter class, new mouse
adapter here

64
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,950
implements all the methods of mouse
listener which

65
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,880
is a dummy kind of, dummy kind of method.

66
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,180
Stops [INAUDIBLE] Ctrl+Shift+O.

67
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,124
Now if I right, if I left-click in there
and

68
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:22,320
right-click and go to Source > Override >
Implement Methods.

69
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,050
These are all the methods of the
mouseAdapter class.

70
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,950
And I'm just going to override this one in
this case: mouseClicked.

71
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,120
Now this has got mouse, a mouseMove
method, but I think

72
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,360
I'm right in saying that if you wanted to
take mouseMoved,

73
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,070
you've got to, you've got to do
addMouseMotionListener, because if you

74
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,130
do addMouseListener, you'll get clicked
events,

75
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,860
but not events relating to movement.

76
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,790
So and in here just to do something with
it, let's just say maybe I've

77
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,094
got this shape called ball and I'll just
set the ball.x

78
00:04:59,094 --> 00:05:03,535
equal to e.getX

79
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:07,975
and ball.y equals

80
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:12,650
e.getY, so the mouse click gets

81
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,450
this mouse event, and the mouse event

82
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,510
has the coordinates where the mouse is
clicked.

83
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,410
So if I run this now, so I'm dragging my
bat

84
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,220
around and if I click, then the ball will
go there.

85
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,910
It actually looks like it's bouncing off
the bat, but it's, it's not, it's just

86
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:35,930
that it's setting it to the actual bat
location when I click it.

87
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,230
Okay so that's it for this tutorial.

88
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,950
And join me again next time.

89
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,030
And until next time, happy coding.
