Hello, this is John from
Caveartprogramming.com, and in this

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,980
tutorial, we're just gonna look at hiding
the cursor.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,772
So sometimes you want to hide the cursor
and especially in

4
00:00:10,772 --> 00:00:15,290
uploads but maybe another swing programs
to games and that kinda thing.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,190
And to do that to make the cursor
invisible, I'm gonna go to

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,110
the construct of my component, which takes
up most of the screen here.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,120
And so here's my constructor.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,240
And I'm gonna say, get tool kit.

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,020
So every component has a method called

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,670
JComponent answer method call get tool
kit.

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,810
And I'm gonna say, set.

12
00:00:42,244 --> 00:00:44,300
I think it set, or is it create?

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,350
Yeah, I've forgotten.

14
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,830
Oh yeah, create custom cursor.

15
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,880
So I'm gonna say, get talk and create
custom cursor.

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:00,091
And now that takes a bunch of arguments
here And the first argument is

17
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:06,710
well the last argument here is gonna be, I
think, it's just a name for the cursor.

18
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,250
I'm gonna set up to an empty string
because it doesn't really matter here.

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,289
Let's put the semicolon on the end.

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,680
This middle argument is the I think it's
the, the cursor kinda hotspot.

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,430
So we're going to pass an image in here
and we wanna say, where the center of

22
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:30,280
the cursor is in that image and I'm just
going to set that to point one comma one.

23
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,920
All right.

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,340
We need to pass a new point here just add
the import.

25
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:41,090
And the most important argument here is,
if I wanna hide the cursor, I need to

26
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,150
create an image here, but it's gonna have
to be a transparent image so I'm gonna

27
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:52,840
have to say new buffered image, and I'm
gonna pass in the size here of one pixel

28
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,695
by one pixel, and for the type of buffered
image, I'm gonna say, buffered image.

29
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:06,480
And I wanna pick a type that has a alpha
argument like type int

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:13,000
ARGB, A stays for alpha, and alpha means
that there's transparency in the image.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,680
So if I put that in there, I'm gonna
create hopefully

32
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,700
a transparent image, that that we wont be
able to see.

33
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,790
So if I run that now.

34
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:23,800
oh, yeah.

35
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,050
You can still see the mouse.

36
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,520
And that's because, I need to set the
cursor, which I almost forgot.

37
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,750
The most important thing.

38
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,180
So we've done create custom cursor here
and that returns a cursor.

39
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,726
So I'm going to say cursor, hidden cursor
equals

40
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:45,060
gettoolkit.createcustom cursor passing
your transparent image,

41
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:53,353
one pixel by one pixel and then, finally,
I'll just do [INAUDIBLE]

42
00:02:53,353 --> 00:03:00,110
and call it set cursor and, pass in that
hidden cursor.

43
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:05,760
I've just created this stuff and now
they're actually, [INAUDIBLE] the end.

44
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,010
And if I run this.

45
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,660
Now the cursor has gone, but it's still
there.

46
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,830
And I can still click it and, and all the
stuff

47
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,150
I can do before I move this bat around
with it.

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:17,905
Okay?

49
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:20,380
So that's it for this tutorial and until
next time.

50
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,120
Happy coding.
