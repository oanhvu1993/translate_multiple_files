00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:05,500
Hello this is John from
caveofprogamming.com.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,190
In this tutorial, we're gonna change tack
completely, because there's

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,520
a few little things left that I still
wanna show you.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,875
And I'm gonna show you how to put together
an applet here,

5
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:20,380
and we're gonna use lots of context for
the last few things.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,632
But most of the stuff I show you here,
applies to any

7
00:00:24,632 --> 00:00:28,500
swing application and you can use it in
any kinda swing application.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,060
And equally the stuff I've showed you
before,

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,130
can nearly all be used in applets as well.

10
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,740
So applets are they are kind of
applications

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,600
that you can embed in a web page.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,150
And often people choose to use Flash
rather than Java for

13
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,210
that these days, but it's used useful,
[LAUGH] I almost said useless.

14
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,520
But it's a useful thing to know in case
you need to know it.

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,530
And they are still used and they are still
useful.

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,740
But a disadvantage of a applet over Flash
is that if

17
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,430
you have an applet embedded in a web page
you'll see

18
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,540
an error, well not error but a warning at
the top

19
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,850
of your browser that says do you want to
run this applet.

20
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,386
And it's kinda just annoying to have to,
you

21
00:01:12,386 --> 00:01:15,580
know, to have to show that error to users.

22
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,540
So if, I think for that reason, more than
any

23
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,750
other, applets aren't massively popular,
but they could be useful.

24
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,410
So let's right click the project folder
here, and I'm

25
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,770
gonna go to a New, we're gonna create a
new class.

26
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,180
And I'll just call this Main, and click
Finish.

27
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,930
Now, I'm gonna make main extend.

28
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,020
Extend JApplet.

29
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,170
So applets don't have to be Swing based,
but they can be.

30
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,480
And this one is going to be, cuz this is a
Swing tutorial series.

31
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,150
I'm gonna do Ctrl+Shift over to add the
import.

32
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:54,867
and, and click Save.

33
00:01:54,867 --> 00:01:59,140
Now JApplet has a bunch of methods that
you will want

34
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,020
to override, or at least you'll want to
override some of them.

35
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,169
And let's have a look at some of the most
important ones in this tutorial.

36
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:10,300
So I've right-clicked there and I go to
Source > Override Implement Methods.

37
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,979
Please excuse the sound of the workmen
working across the road here.

38
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:21,100
And I'm gonna go, let's, there's a lot of
messages here, a lot of methods here, that

39
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:26,580
you could over ride, but there's about
four that are particularly important.

40
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,330
I think the swing specific ones, are

41
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,890
generally you can probably usually leave
them alone.

42
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:36,710
If you go into Applet here, its JApplet
derives or extends applet.

43
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,220
We've got a we've got an init method.

44
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,610
Init is where you do any initialization
that you have to in your applet.

45
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,650
So it's kind of like a constructor, but
rather than doing

46
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,600
initialization in a constructor, for an
applet, you do it in init.

47
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,888
And, and that's called when the applet's
kinda sat up.

48
00:02:56,888 --> 00:03:01,190
And you would connect to a database in
init, as well if you want to.

49
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,330
And if you have to destroy anything, like
you have to

50
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,310
close the database connection or anything,
you do it and destroy.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,350
And there's also a start method.

52
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:17,800
Start is called whenever your upload is
displayed and if the user

53
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,070
goes to different internet page, browses
away from the upload, stop will be called.

54
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,250
So if your applet has to run, in any
sense, you, like for example if you've got

55
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,830
a timer or a game loop, you wanna start it
running in start, and you wanna stop it.

56
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,020
Whenever stop is called and then it starts
cold again you wanna restart it.

57
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:42,760
So, we're gonna just work with these four,
I think and this tutorials.

58
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:47,220
so, let's just for, for a moment.

59
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,371
Let's just put some sysout in there and
we'll

60
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:51,570
look into this and get more detail in
future.

61
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:56,700
So sysout there we go.

62
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,254
All right init, lets just copy that.

63
00:04:01,254 --> 00:04:06,134
And let's put destroy, destroy.

64
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:10,470
And in here I'll have start and in here of
course stop.

65
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,930
Now, we're gonna to look up how to embed
this in a webpage, but,

66
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,030
for the moment, to test your applet, you
can just click run like this.

67
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,330
And this is your applet running.

68
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,870
There is nothing to see at the moment.

69
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,113
You can see that init has been called.

70
00:04:28,113 --> 00:04:32,049
It was called first of all, and then start
is called, and

71
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:36,889
then, if I quit this applet, we're gonna
get stop and then destroy.

72
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,040
And stop, bear in mind that start and stop
can be

73
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,660
called multiple times by the applets in
business, so to speak.

74
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,800
So that's it for this tutorial; join me

75
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,757
again next time and until next time, happy
coding.

76
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:50,017
