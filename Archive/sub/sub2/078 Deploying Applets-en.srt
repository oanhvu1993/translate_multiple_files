00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,990
Hello this is John from
caveofprogramming.com and in

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,446
this tutorial we're gonna look at
deploying your applet.

3
00:00:08,446 --> 00:00:17,250
So applet deploying applets can get
potentially a little bit complex.

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,590
And can do stuff like figure out if the
user has the right version of the the

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,060
Java plugin needed to run it and download

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,490
it automatically if not and that kind of
thing.

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,190
But in here I'm just gonna show you a
really simple way of deploying

8
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:35,690
it and if you need more information I
shall refer you to Google because I

9
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,460
don't want to get too diverted with
applets cuz this is really a Swing

10
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,010
tutorial, but just for the sake of

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,670
completeness, let's take a quick look at
this.

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,780
So at the moment my applet runs and I've

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,560
got this applet that's set to 600 by 500
here.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,740
And I'm gonna right click the project
folder and

15
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,400
I'm gonna go to Export JAR file cause I

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,780
want to create a JAR file with all my

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,080
applet's resources and class file and I'll
click Next.

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,280
I often find with this wizard actually
that it remembers settings

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,430
from previous projects, and sometimes that
can cause problems and you'll have

20
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,390
to fiddle around with it a bit and make
sure it

21
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,620
has settings compatible with your current
project which is a slight annoyance.

22
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,070
And but I've actually filled in some

23
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,050
settings already to, to check that this
works.

24
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,120
And, I want here to export generator

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,200
class files and resources, that's very
important.

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,740
I could put my source files in there as

27
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,550
well if I want but that's absolutely not
necessary.

28
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,310
And I'm gonna export this to this path
here.

29
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,430
I'm gonna call it deploy.jar.

30
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,740
I'm calling it deploy.jar it could be
called absolutely anything.

31
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,260
We're gonna export that JAR file to this,
this directory.

32
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,360
And let's just go through the list click
Next, and you

33
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,110
probably want to uncheck export class
files with compile errors because of

34
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,310
course there shouldn't be any compile
errors in your code if

35
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,512
you're exporting it and if there is you
need to fix them.

36
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:06,910
But the compile warnings you don't need to
worry

37
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,490
about cuz they can be stuff like not
having a

38
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,650
serialization ID when you know, eclipse
thinks you, should

39
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,190
or java thinks you should and that's
completely not important.

40
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,530
So I click Next here.

41
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,530
And I, I set these settings for a previous
project and now I can't unset them so what

42
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,745
I've done is just, it wants to say this

43
00:02:28,745 --> 00:02:34,910
manifest file, which contains information,
meta information about the applet.

44
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,480
We want to save it in my project
directory, so I've set it to

45
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,405
the current project directory and call it

46
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:42,360
manifest.mf, but this is really not
important.

47
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,250
Just as long as you can bond some settings
in

48
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:50,000
there that lets your jar be created
successfully then it's fine.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,600
And if you haven't touched this you
probably don't need to touch it.

50
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,340
So I don't need to set the main class for
an

51
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,080
applet and I'm just gonna click Finish
keep my fingers crossed.

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,320
So I got warnings which is fine, but if
you

53
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,793
get errors that's a problem and I'm just
gonna click OK.

54
00:03:05,793 --> 00:03:08,145
And now if I go to that directory,

55
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:12,190
the one that I selected, I've got this
deployed.jar.

56
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,320
And now, I'm going to create and HTML file
to view that deploy.jar.

57
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,929
And I could probably use Eclipse, but it's

58
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:21,538
simpler to use just a plainer kind of
program

59
00:03:21,538 --> 00:03:24,005
it's text, and I'm going to use the free

60
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:27,619
Notepad ++ for this, which is, I highly
recommend.

61
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:31,211
And you can just just do a Google search
for Notepad pu-,

62
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:31,211
.

63
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,340
Notepad++, and you'll find it.

64
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,750
So I'm gonna create a minimal HTML file
here a minimal webpage, and I'm

65
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:45,220
gonna have an opening HTML tag and a
closing HTML tag.

66
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,330
And to embed the applet in this I'm gonna
use

67
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:51,680
the applet type, which I think is actually
deprecated from HTML4.

68
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,500
So if you really want to seriously get
into

69
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,470
applets, you probably want to take a
little bit of

70
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,850
time to look up the official latest best
way to

71
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,660
deploy an applet and and to bundle that
code in.

72
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,520
I'm just going to use a simple applet tag
here.

73
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,170
And let's close the tag, there.

74
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,720
And I'm gonna have a few attributes here.

75
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,090
I'll have a, a width matching the,
matching my

76
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,030
the width I set in my applet in it.

77
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,610
Width of 600.

78
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,740
And I'm gonna have a height of 500.

79
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,960
I think these values are all not
mandatory, but I'm not sure.

80
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,360
And the important attributes that you do
need are, firstly

81
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,310
archive which has to specify the location
of your JAR file.

82
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,490
And we'll see in a minute, this is gonna

83
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,280
be a URL if you're deploying it on the
web.

84
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,070
But since this is going to be in my local
directory and since I'm

85
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,540
going to save the HTML file in the same
directory as the JAR file.

86
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,290
I just need the name of the JAR here,
deploy.jar.

87
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,130
And finally, the code attribute, again
very

88
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,320
important, and that's gonna specify your
main class.

89
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,799
And my main class here is.

90
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,270
It's it's this class in the default
package called main.

91
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,660
So you need the, the full class path
there.

92
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,575
So if this is a patch called, package
called gooey, I'd need gooey.main.class.

93
00:05:20,632 --> 00:05:25,850
But this is in the default package, so I'm
just gonna set

94
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:31,350
that to main.class and I'm gonna save
this.

95
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,530
And I'll save it in the same directory as

96
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,560
the deploy.jar I've created and I'll just
call that applet.html.

97
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,640
And let's just run this by I'll just
double click it and open it in my browser.

98
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,820
And the only thing about applets is you
get this thing here.

99
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,020
Actually this is saying my Java plug-in is
out of date.

100
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,710
I'm just gonna click, run this time.

101
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,740
Say that I want to run the applet.

102
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,980
And there is my applet.

103
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,490
It doesn't do anything at the moment but
you can see that it has displayed.

104
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,670
Now if you let's say for example, you have
your let's create a package here.

105
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,433
Like I don't know.

106
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:17,160
So I'll say New>Package>gui, let's say,
Finish.

107
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,260
And let's take these files and move them
into the GUI package.

108
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,960
And, so now they're in there, and if go
look

109
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,580
at name, you'll see it says package GUI at
the top.

110
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:35,350
And I'm gonna right click again and go to
export and JAR file next.

111
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:41,720
I'm gonna to go through screen with the
same settings, and now

112
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:49,000
if I wanna deploy it I'm gonna have to say
GUI dot.

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,700
In fact, I think I need slash.

114
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,000
Well let's just check this.

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,338
So if I run that now and run this time.

116
00:06:57,338 --> 00:07:01,670
Then yeah I actually need, because it's,
this literally references

117
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,775
the file within JAR, I think it's slash
that you need.

118
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:05,050
Okay.

119
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,840
So let's check that.

120
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,270
Run this time.

121
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:08,530
Okay.

122
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,860
There we go.

123
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,385
So you've got to make sure, because when
you when

124
00:07:12,385 --> 00:07:17,770
you create packages, of course they map to
kind of folders.

125
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,750
You probably know already.

126
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,420
They kind of map to folders in your
directory structure.

127
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:28,326
So, in my JAR file I can hear, in

128
00:07:28,326 --> 00:07:34,090
my bin, it's going to end up with a GUI
folder like that, with my class in it.

129
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:39,110
And that's gonna match this here.

130
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,610
Now let's just take a quick look at what
you do

131
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,250
to deploy it on the internet, and that's
very, very simple.

132
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:51,167
And I've actually got a I've actually got
a web I've got a

133
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:57,970
a server running the Apache web server is
running on my on my machine here.

134
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,200
And let's just go into applet here.

135
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:06,760
And actually I don't know if I can maybe
cut that from there.

136
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,770
Yeah, seems like it will let me.

137
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:13,170
Let's go to, I'm gonna go to a folder on
my disc called picture squirrel.

138
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:16,175
And the reason it's called picture
squirrel is.

139
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:20,610
Oh yeah, I can't actually cut it because I
think my Chrome

140
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:25,640
browser is kind of got a lock on this
file, so I'm gonna

141
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,140
copy it instead, I'm going to copy and I'm
gonna go to the

142
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:34,740
directory that my web server's serving
things from and paste it in there.

143
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,990
And just to prove the that this works,
I'll change the name of this actually.

144
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,860
Let's call that applet.jar.

145
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,400
Now, this directory, cpicturesquirrel
here, it's called picture squirrel

146
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,970
because I'm working on a website called
picture squirrel.

147
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:59,500
But this this map's to my local host
matches the local host on my machine.

148
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,860
So if I go to local host here this is the
website that I'm

149
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:08,280
running, and now what I'm gonna do is
gonna take this HTML file and applet.

150
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,700
Let's right click > copy in this applet
folder.

151
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:17,410
And going to paste it in this
picturesquirrel folder, paste,

152
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,520
and let's right click and edit in

153
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,970
notepad, Notepad++, because I changed the
name of it, I need to change it to applet.

154
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,630
Now this now needs to be a URL because the

155
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,680
whole point of what I'm showing you here
really is

156
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,470
that if you have this JAR on the internet,
then

157
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,100
in your HTML file, this is gonna stay the
same.

158
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,410
This is fine, but you're going to have to
change this to a URL.

159
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,460
So I'll have HTTP

160
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,910
colon slash slash, and of course this is
gonna have to be, in my case localhost.

161
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,960
Because I'm just running this on my local
machine.

162
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,150
Strobe applet.jar.

163
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:59,010
And of course, you'd probably want to
check that, that is correct.

164
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:03,420
Let me just copy that, and go to my
browser here, and paste it in here.

165
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:11,270
And it seems not to have found it, so
maybe I did something wrong.

166
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,207
So I've got my applet.jar there.

167
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:16,904
Oh yeah, I've, I actually need to put this
in my public HTML folder.

168
00:10:16,904 --> 00:10:22,588
So let's copy that and copy that and do
Ctrl+X

169
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:28,915
and go to public HTML and paste this in
here.

170
00:10:28,915 --> 00:10:32,192
Oh, I've already got an applet.html but
that's not important.

171
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:34,108
I'll replace them.

172
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:38,309
So here's applet.html and applet.jar.

173
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:40,830
And let's check that the JAR file is
there.

174
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,540
And it is cuz it's asking me if I want to
download it.

175
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,600
So I know that the URL in my HTML file is
right.

176
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,930
And now let's go to applet.html and run
this time.

177
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,690
And there's my applet.

178
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:59,220
So the take home message here is let's get
rid of that.

179
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,890
Is that let's actually open the right one
again.

180
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,510
Is that if you have your applet on the
internet.

181
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,220
So let's see, in this case it's in my
local folder.

182
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:19,820
But wherever you put it you need to make
sure that the that this URL is correct and

183
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,910
correctly references your JAR file, which
you'll need to upload to your web server.

184
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,160
Okay, so that's it for this tutorial.

185
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,830
As I said, there's a lot more you can do
with

186
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:34,870
deploying applets and, and you probably
don't wanna really use this, but

187
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,010
I, I just wanted to show you this just so
you

188
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:41,160
can get it working and just for the sake
of completeness, really.

189
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,550
So that's it for this tutorial.

190
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,690
Join me again next time and until next
time happy programming.
