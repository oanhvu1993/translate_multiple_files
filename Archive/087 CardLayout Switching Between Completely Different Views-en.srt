00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,090
Hello this is John from
caveofprogamming.com.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,740
And in this tutorial we're gonna look at
card layout.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,900
So, card layout let's you switch

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,730
between completely different views in your
application.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,407
So if I run this now, I've got this panel
showing

6
00:00:17,407 --> 00:00:20,360
up with a button that just outputs text at
the moment.

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,670
But I want this button to switch to a
completely different view.

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,390
Which is gonna be my game thingamajig.

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,950
And you can use card, a kind of card
layout.

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,560
It's like a kind of deck of cards

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,150
where you can switch between the different
cards.

12
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,810
And you can have as man as you like.

13
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,074
And I'm gonna use that to switch from this
to my game.

14
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:43,271
You can use them of course not only in
games but also

15
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:48,670
in, for example dialogue to create wizards
and all that kind of thing.

16
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:54,030
Now so here my main my main class

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,046
which is an applet in this particular
case.

18
00:00:59,046 --> 00:01:01,678
I've got my two panels, so this is my game

19
00:01:01,678 --> 00:01:04,360
is a J component it take up the whole
screen.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:11,738
And this start panel is a panel, which of
course is also a type of jcomponent.

21
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:19,100
I'm gonna start here by creating here a
private card layout, card layout.

22
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,380
I'll call it cards and add the import with
Ctrl+Shift+O.

23
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,360
And in my init method, all this will be
your

24
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,464
probably your constructor if you're doing
a desktop screen program.

25
00:01:31,464 --> 00:01:39,220
I'm gonna say Cards equals newCardLayout.

26
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:39,720
There we go.

27
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,650
And now where do I set layout, at the
moment I'm setting a board layout.

28
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,750
I am gonna change that to my card layout.

29
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,640
And when I do add, instead of adding using
these

30
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,250
board layout constants, I am gonna add
using a descriptive string.

31
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:00,740
So, I am gonna call the start panel, start
and then let's also add the game.

32
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,015
And I'll call that game.

33
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:08,166
So these are just strings that you kinda
make up so

34
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:13,090
you can refer to your different components
or panels later on.

35
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,899
And now, so if I run that the, the one
that I added first will be the

36
00:02:16,899 --> 00:02:19,672
one that's visible, which is my start
panel,

37
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,610
so it still looks the same at the moment.

38
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,925
But what I'm gonna do is instead of
outputting hello

39
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:31,110
there when I click the button, I want to
say cards.show.

40
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,120
And show has two arguments here.

41
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,139
So let's try to bring up the autocomplete
for that cuz that will be informative.

42
00:02:40,214 --> 00:02:43,440
cards.show.

43
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,020
There we go.

44
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:49,640
So you need to pass in the parent
container and and the

45
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,930
name that you added, the string that you
added when you did add.

46
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,490
Now if you yeah.

47
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,980
Actually, one thing I forgot to mention
before was that,

48
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,440
and this is the same for an applet or a
JFrame.

49
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,300
When you add components to the JFrame or
to a

50
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,650
JApplet with add you're not strictly
speaking, adding them to the

51
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,654
JFrame or JApplet class you're adding them
to its content

52
00:03:17,654 --> 00:03:20,770
pane, which is kind of like a panel that
it contains.

53
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,914
And you can get that content pain if you
want.

54
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:26,920
I didn't get content pain.

55
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,330
And that will allow you to set it's

56
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,770
background color and all that kind of
thing.

57
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,624
So if you want to set the background color
of

58
00:03:31,624 --> 00:03:33,815
JFrame you need to do,

59
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:36,700
getContentPane().setBackground or whatever
it is.

60
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,750
That's worth bearing in mind.

61
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,660
And the relevance here is that I don't
want

62
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,760
to pass in, literally a reference to the
parent.

63
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,815
I want to pass in a reference to the
content pane of the parent.

64
00:03:48,815 --> 00:03:51,016
Now in an anonymous class here.

65
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:55,767
So if I type, I can't type this
getContactPanel because this would be

66
00:03:55,767 --> 00:04:01,627
refer to this anonymous class here which
implements startPanelListener.

67
00:04:01,627 --> 00:04:08,489
To get that this reference of the parent
frame, cuz my parent class is called main,

68
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:15,202
I can say main.this, which is kind of a
strange syntax but that's how it works.

69
00:04:15,202 --> 00:04:20,987
And then, from there I can get the, I can
use, I can call up the getContentPane

70
00:04:20,987 --> 00:04:26,850
method of the parent, in this case a
JApplet, or it may be a JFrame.

71
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:32,400
So let's add that in and so that gives me
the parent container of the, that

72
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,220
I've set the card layer on, which is

73
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,620
actually the content frame of this
enclosing main class.

74
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,480
And now I'm just gonna pass in the
descriptive string which is gonna be

75
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,740
game, because I want it to switch to game
when you click the button.

76
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,760
So now let's run that.

77
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,000
And of course, you can have as many of

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,270
these panels as you want, and switch
between different ones.

79
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:03,120
And in, yeah, I, I just wanna remind you
as well, in the last tutorial I added

80
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,620
to the content, the start panel here,
which I created using the visual designer.

81
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,210
I added this set listener method.

82
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,840
And I set the main class as a listener.

83
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,940
And I call fire start game, which calls
start game in the listener.

84
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,010
Actually, it's not the main class for
editors,

85
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,120
the list is strictly speaking, but this
anonymous class.

86
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,880
So when you click the button, invokes this
basically.

87
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,270
This is listening to the panel.

88
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,998
So let's just run that, and now if I click
new simulation, it

89
00:05:35,998 --> 00:05:39,370
goes to my simulation or game or whatever
you like to call it.

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,646
So, that's it for this tutorial.

91
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:46,580
And in the next tutorial, we're gonna look
at making this that actually work.

92
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,890
So, join me again then and until next
time, happy coding.
